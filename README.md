## Build

Install [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos) and git.

Clone the GitHub repository with `git clone https://github.com/lebao3105/Little12.git`.

Run `make package` and it will compile the deb in ./packages/ directory.

### Code formatting

Install clang-format first.

Then run:

```bash
$ clang-format -i --style=file:.clang-format --files=.clang-format-files
```

Never run this on Logos files!

The code format options were taken [here.](https://github.com/paulsfds/objective-c-style-guide/blob/master/.clang-format)

*All tweaks drain battery life, which is something that can not be avoided; however, Little12 drains less battery compared to similar tweaks.
